## Overview
During my internship, I focused on building AI models that address everyday challenges in safety, security, and efficiency. Each project involved experimenting with advanced architectures, curating datasets, and optimizing for real-world deployment. The journey was filled with iterationsâ€”from initial failures to polished prototypesâ€”teaching me the art of resilient AI development.

## Projects

### PPE Detection â€” Safeguarding Environments with Precision
Aimed at identifying personal protective equipment in diverse settings to boost safety protocols.

**Tech Stack**:
- Python as the backbone.
- YOLOv8 and SigLIP for detection/classification.
- Zero-shot techniques (CLIP-inspired) for adaptability.
- Various open datasets for robust training.

**Development Flow**:
Began with standard detectors and classifiers, which struggled in variable conditions. Pivoted to zero-shot methods for flexibility, but latency crept in during validations. Fine-tuned with SigLIP for superior accuracy and rapid processing.

**Hurdles Cleared**: Managing trade-offs between responsiveness and reliability in unpredictable scenarios.

**Real-World Value**: Integrates effortlessly into monitoring systems, cutting down errors and supporting compliance in high-risk areas.

### Violence Detection â€” Unraveling Motion Patterns
This involved scrutinizing video streams to detect aggressive actions, emphasizing sequence analysis over static frames.

**Tech Stack**:
- Python with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Models: CNN-LSTM combos and 3D CNNs.
- Assorted open-source action datasets.

**Development Flow**:
Tested hybrid architectures for temporal insights, training on broad datasets. 3D CNN stood out for low false alerts, particularly distinguishing sports from threats amid vigorous movements.

**Hurdles Cleared**: Curbing over-detections in energetic contexts like athletics.

**Real-World Value**: Enhances surveillance for timely interventions in public venues, fostering safer communities.

### Clothing and Age Classifier â€” Insightful Person Profiling
Focused on recognizing apparel types (upper/lower) and categorizing people by age group, with applications in customization and oversight.

**Tech Stack**:
- YOLOv8 for precise bounding.
- Custom-annotated datasets for age.
- Depth estimation trials (monocular approaches).
- Python for data prep and training.

**Development Flow**:
Utilized a vast open dataset for clothing detection via YOLOv8, achieving solid performance. For age, bypassed simplistic box rules (ineffective at distances) and depth tools (too sluggish), opting for a richly labeled dataset from multiple viewpoints.

**Hurdles Cleared**: Overcoming scale and angle variances without site-specific setups.

**Real-World Value**: Powers personalized services, such as targeted ads or access controls, in a config-free manner.

### Airport Object Detection â€” Streamlining Aviation Operations
Targeted spotting specialized gear like refuelers, loaders, bridges, and aircraft in busy terminals.

**Tech Stack**:
- Hand-curated and labeled datasets.
- YOLO variants for multi-target tracking.
- Python pipelines for annotation and iteration.

**Development Flow**:
Due to sparse public data, built our own collection and trained models. Addressing overfitting: Performs great locally but falters elsewhere; expanding to global sources for better universality.

**Hurdles Cleared**: Combating data shortages and site-specific quirks.

**Real-World Value**: Optimizes ground ops and safety, automating tracking across international hubs.

## Technologies Used
- **Core Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: YOLOv8, TensorFlow/Keras, SigLIP, CLIP
- **Architectures**: 3D CNNs, CNN-LSTM, Zero-Shot Learning
- **Data Tools**: Open-source datasets, manual labeling, depth estimators
- **Environments**: Focused on speed-optimized inference for deployment

## Challenges and Triumphs
- **PPE**: From sluggish zeros-shot to efficient SigLIPâ€”boosted inference by 2x.
- **Violence**: 3D CNN slashed false positives in motion-heavy clips.
- **Clothing/Age**: Custom data trumped hardware-dependent fixes.
- **Airport**: Overfitting ongoing; aiming for worldwide robustness.
  
Overall: Navigated data scarcity, model tweaks, and performance balancing with iterative testing.

## Key Takeaways
- Gained proficiency in CV powerhouses like YOLO and 3D CNNs, plus dataset mastery.
- Embraced adaptability: Shifting from rigid models to versatile zero-shot paradigms.
- Deployment wisdom: Prioritize quick, generalizable solutions sans custom calibrations.
- Fueled my drive for AI that solves tangible problems in industries like safety and logistics. This experience was a launchpad for future innovations! ðŸŒŸ
